\section{Introduction}
The nmoutput2so tool creates and populates a DDMoRe standard output \cite{Terranova} xml file given the output from one or more NONMEM runs. It is necessary that the format of the model file and other files follow a set of requirements for this to work. \\
The Perl module XML::LibXML is required by nmoutput2so, but not PsN in general. Make sure that it is installed before using nmoutput2so (If you are using ActivePerl on Windows please read the section on installation below). See the PsN installation guide for intructions.\\
Examples:
\begin{verbatim}
nmoutput2so run1.lst run2.lst
\end{verbatim}
This will add the NONMEM output from run1.lst in an SOBlock called run1 and the output from run2.lst to an SOBlock called run2. All information that is possible to extract and that is supported will be added to the generated SO file, which will be called run1.SO.xml. 
\begin{verbatim}
nmoutput2so -bootstrap_results=bootstrap_results.csv
-so_filename=res.SO.xml
\end{verbatim}
This will add the PsN bootstrap results to a lone SOBlock in the file called res.SO.xml.
\section{Input and options}

\subsection{Required input}
One or more NONMEM results files (.lst) and or -bootstrap\_results and or -vpc\_results (see those options) is mandatory. One SOBlock will be created for each .lst file and the bootstrap/vpc results will be added to the first SOBlock or in it 
own block if no .lst files were specified. Wildcards will work (i.e. *.lst).

\section{Requirements on the model file and other files}

\subsection{Requirements on the model file}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is recommended that all NONMEM parameters (THETAs, OMEGAs and SIGMAs) have labels. A label is a one word (and only one word) comment on the same line as the definition of the initial estimate of the parameter. This means that all block definitions must be written on different rows. Example:
        \begin{verbatim}
$OMEGA BLOCK(2)
 1.2     ; PPV_CL
 0.01    ; CORR_CL_V
 0.1     ; PPV_V
        \end{verbatim}
        Paramaters without labels will get a mangled name i.e. THETA(1) becomes THETA\_1\_
    \item To be able to populate the Residuals and the Predictions entries (or SimulatedProfiles for simulations) an sdtab table must be specified. The names but not the order of the columns is important. ID and TIME must be in the table. Other columns are optional. The example below shows an sdtab with all columns. The name of the file must start with "sdtab".\\ Example:
        \begin{verbatim}
$TABLE ID TIME MDV DV PRED IPRED RES IRES WRES IWRES CWRES
NOAPPEND FILE=sdtab2
        \end{verbatim}
    \item To be able to populate the IndividualEstimates (or the IndivParameters for simulations) entry a patab table must be specified. NOAPPEND must be used and the order of the columns is important. The first column must be ID, then comes all individual parameters followed by the ETAs (see below).\newpage Example:
        \begin{verbatim}
$TABLE ID CL V ETA_CL ETA_V NOAPPEND FILE=patab
        \end{verbatim}
    \item To be able to populate the Covariates entry in Simulation a cotab table must be specified. The names but not the order of the columns are important. ID and TIME must be in the table. Other columns are covariates. The name of the file must start with "cotab".\\ Example:
        \begin{verbatim}
$TABLE ID TIME WGT NOPRINT NOAPPEND FILE=cotab
        \end{verbatim}
    \item To be able to populate the RandomEffects entries all ETAs must be defined in the main code block (\$PK or \$PRED). One ETA should be defined per row with nothing more on the row (except for spaces) than one assignment.\\ Example:
        \begin{verbatim}
 ETA_CL = ETA(1)
 ETA_V = ETA(2)
        \end{verbatim}
    \item ETAs used for interoccasion variability must be handled like this:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The \$OMEGA record describing the first occation is a normal omega BLOCK record and the following occasions are BLOCK SAME. Currently SAME(n) is not supported so each occasion must have its separate \$OMEGA record.\\ Example for three different occasions:
            \begin{verbatim}
$OMEGA BLOCK(4)
0.1 ; BOV_CL
0
0.1 ; BOV_V
0
0
0.1 ; BOV_KA
0
0
0
0.1 ; BOV_TL

$OMEGA BLOCK(4) SAME

$OMEGA BLOCK(4) SAME
            \end{verbatim}
            \item In the main code block (\$PK or \$PRED) the ETAs for the different occasions must be combined with the special \$ABBR syntax. Example for two occasions:
            \begin{verbatim}
$ABBR REPLACE ETA(OCC_ETA_BOV_CL) = ETA(5,9)
$ABBR REPLACE ETA(OCC_ETA_BOV_V) = ETA(6,10)
$ABBR REPLACE ETA(OCC_ETA_BOV_KA) = ETA(7,11)
$ABBR REPLACE ETA(OCC_ETA_BOV_TL) = ETA(8,12)
            \end{verbatim}
        \item In the main code block (\$PK or \$PRED) the combined ETAs must be assigned to variables using the correct name of the ETA and the correct name of the occasion. Example:
            \begin{verbatim}
ETA_BOV_CL = ETA(OCC_ETA_BOV_CL)
ETA_BOV_V = ETA(OCC_ETA_BOV_V)
ETA_BOV_KA = ETA(OCC_ETA_BOV_KA)
ETA_BOV_TL = ETA(OCC_ETA_BOV_TL)
            \end{verbatim}
        \end{itemize}
    \item If multiple DVs are to be used a DVID column must be set in the sdtab.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Requirements on other files}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All NONMEM	 result files must have the same filename (excluding extension) as the .lst file. If not it is impossible to pick up the results from the .ext, .cov, .cor files etc.
\end{itemize}

\section{Known limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The full xml file is stored in memory at once. This means that big results, for example big simulations, can potentially use a lot or all of the available memory.
    \item To be able to filter out dose rows for SimulatedProfiles and Residuals and MDV column must be included in the sdtab otherwise all rows will be added.
    \item PopulationParameters for simulations are assumed to be fixed for all individuals and occations thus not supporting \$PRIOR
    \item All parameters in a bootstrap will be on the var/cov scale regardless of the scale used in the model.
    \item Parameters with no labels will not generate any warnings for bootstrap when given on the sd/corr scale.
    \item Only the first \$PROBLEM will be added to the SO
    \item When using between occasion variability, which transalate to \$OMEGA BLOCK SAME in NONMEM, the OMEGAs for the SAME BLOCKs will be added to the PopulationParameters. These omegas will have their generic names (i.e. OMEGA\_2\_2)
\end{itemize}

\section{Output}

The resulting standard output object xml will be written to the file called <name of .lst file>.so\_xml.

The following entries will be populated:

\begin{itemize}
    \item RawResults - All used files and some selected not used files will be added. See the section on raw results for more info
    \item TaskInformation

            \item Message - Errors, warnings etc will be put here. See section "information messages"
            \item RunTime - From the .lst file. Remember that RunTime only reflects the run time reported by NONMEM in the .lst file. No PsN runtime will be reported.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Estimation
        \begin{itemize}
            \item PopulationEstimates

            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{vpc}
If nmoutput2so was run with the -rundir option in a vpc directory the original data table and the simulations table will be added.
The original data table to ModelDiagnostic/DiagnosticStructuralModel/IndivObservationPrediction and the simulations table to
Simulation/SimulationBlock/SimulatedProfiles (each replicate in its own table).


\subsection{Raw results}
Some special raw results files in the RawResults section of the SO will have a specific oid set. This makes it easier to programatically find the files. Here follows a list of these files and oids:

\begin{tabular}{ l l}
      oid & file \\
    \hline
      PsN\_bootstrap\_results & bootstrap\_results.csv \\
      PsN\_bootstrap\_included\_individuals & included\_individuals1.csv \\
      PsN\_bootstrap\_raw\_results & raw\_results\_<model>.csv \\
      PsN\_SSE\_results & sse\_results.csv \\
      PsN\_SSE\_raw\_results & raw\_results\_<model>.csv \\
      PsN\_VPC\_results & vpc\_results.csv \\
      PsN\_VPC\_vpctab & vpctab<num> \\
\end{tabular}



\subsection{Information messages}
A set of tool specific information messages are added in TaskInformation. They are listed table below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{estimation\_successful} \\ Set to 1 if the estimation was successful otherwise set to 0.
    \item \textbf{covariance\_step\_run} \\ Set to 1 if the covariance step was run otherwise set to 0. The information is taken from the .lst file
    \item \textbf{covariance\_step\_successful} \\ Set to 1 if the covariance step was successful
    \item \textbf{covariance\_step\_warnings} \\ Set to 1 if any of "R MATRIX ALGORITHMICALLY SINGULAR" or "S MATRIX ALGORITHMICALLY SINGULAR" is present in the .lst file. Set to 0 otherwise.
    \item \textbf{rounding\_errors} \\ Set to 1 if "ROUNDING ERRORS" is present in the .lst file.  Set to 0 otherwise.
    \item \textbf{hessian\_reset} \\ Set to the number of appearances of "RESET HESSIAN" in the .lst file
    \item \textbf{zero\_gradients} \\ Set to the number of zero gradients in the "GRADIENT" lists of the .lst file
    \item \textbf{final\_zero\_gradients} \\ Number of zero gradients in the final iteration in the .lst file.
    \item \textbf{estimate\_near\_boundary} \\ Set to 1 if any of "ESTIMATE OF THETA IS NEAR THE BOUNDARY" or "PARAMETER ESTIMATE IS NEAR ITS BOUNDARY" is present in the .lst file. Set to 0 otherwise.
    \item \textbf{significant\_digits} \\ NO. OF SIG. DIGITS IN FINAL EST. from .lst file
    \item \textbf{s\_matrix\_singular} \\ Set to 1 if "S MATRIX ALGORITHMICALLY SINGULAR" present in .lst file. Set to 0 otherwise.
    \item \textbf{condition\_number} \\ If the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix was printed to the .lst file (i.e. option PRINT=E was given to \$COV) nnmoutput2so calculates the condition number. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Installation on Windows and ActivePerl}
If you are running windows and ActivePerl installation is a bit more complicated and can only be recommended for people highly skilled in perl package installation and in manual installation of dll:s in Windows. It is strongly recommended to use Strawberry perl instead of ActivePerl if you intend to run nmoutput2so.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Not all versions of the ppm system comes with XML-LibXML precompiled. If not you'll need to compile it yourself either manually or by installing from cpan.
    \item ActivePerl (unlike Strawberry perl) does not come with libxml2, which is a dependency of the XML-LibXML package, bundled. You will need to install the appropriate dll:s manually. The libxml2 webpage has information on how to do this.
\end{itemize}

Describing any of the above procedures is beyond the scope of this documentation.
