\section{Overview}
Quality assurance (qa) is a tool to assess the quality of a final model. The analysis is not done directly on the final model, but on certain model proxies to speed up the analysis time.
The proxies include a linearized version of the model to be qa:ed as well as additional modeling of the residuals from that model \cite{Khandelwal, Svensson, Ibrahim}. The idea is that these simplified models will provide similar improvement in goodness-of-it (OFV) and similar parameter estimates with a model change as if the same model change had been done directly on the non-linear model. The model proxies however are running much faster and are more robust. 

The suggested use of the resulting report is that first inspect the overview section and there assess whether any change to the model resulted in an improvement of such a size that it would be of interest to learn more about it. If so, there is more information in the subsections. If not, the qa functionality has provided reassurance that the model in a large number of aspects describe the data well. 

The "Structural" section contains information additional information about bias in the population predictions versus different independent variables.  If this bias is low, despite a marked improvement in OFV, an argument can be made about the clinical relevance of the bias. This size and direction of the bias may also suggest a new model structure. Note though that also covariate or stochastic model misspecification can result in bias and may be best to corrected for first. 

The "Parameter Variability Model" section extensions to the IIV model are tested \cite{Svensson, Petersson}. If any model suggests an improvement, the PsN functionality "transform" can easily make the corresponding change to the original model (learn through \verb|transform -help|).

The "Covariates" section explores covariate relations in addition to those already present in the model. A very strong, but correctly implemented covariate in the original model, should not provide a signal in this analysis. Thus for a model with correctly implemented covariates this would provide only marginal improvements. Two methods are used: a univariate estimation of all individual parameter-covariate relations (the typical first step in an SCM \cite{Jonsson2}), and a full random effects model (FREM \cite{Karlsson, Yun, Yngman}) which estimates simultaneously all parameter-covariate relations using the baseline covariate values.

"Residual Error Model" explores a number of extensions to the original residual error model \cite{Ibrahim, Karlsson2, Karlsson3, Dosne2012}. (For dtbs there is functionality in PsN to transform the original model automatically (see option dtbs after \verb|execute â€“help|). 

"Influential individuals" are identified through a case-deletion diagnostics routine where the model is reestimated after dropping one subject at a time (subject i). The metric used is the difference in OFV for all subjects except subject i between the model with all subjects included and the model where subject i is dropped. This difference should always be positive as the model will always fit the remaining subjects better when subject I has been omitted. If the difference is >3.84 (the cut-off used for declaring an influential subject) it means that a parameter may have changed significantly (@ p<0.05) by the presence of the subject, hence influential.

"Outliers" are subjects for which the model fits poorly. In this evaluation outlier status is judged based the overall goodness of fit to an individual's data \cite{Largajolli}. For an individual with such a characteristic, it may be further evaluated whether it is due to unusual parameter values and/or outlying observations (see simeval functionality in PsN). The metric presented for outlying subjects is the same as for Influential Individuals. Naturally an individual that is both outlying and influential is of particular concern.

The qa tool avoids a full estimation of the input model and generates the proxies at final estimates of the input model. For an optimal performance of qa, the lst, ext and phi files need to be present.

\section{Known limitations and problems}

Some limitations and problems will affect the ability to generate any output, other will impact one or some of the different evaluations, but still result in an output report. 

\subsection{General limitations and problems}
\begin{itemize}
	\item There is no support in qa for categorical data, including handling censored continuous data using the M3/M4 likelihood-based methods
	\item There is no support in qa for the first-order (FO) method. Testing with FOCE(I) has been extensive, and sparse with other methods (LAPLACE, SAEM, ITS, IMP and IMPMAP). BAYES has not been tested. 
	\item With linearization and eta-epsilon interaction (INTER) individual estimates of empirical Bayes estimates (EBE) of parameters may end up in local minima. The most prominent sign of this is that differences in OFV between two models have a sign, different from that expected, i.e. a smaller model may have a lower OFV than a full model. One experimental remedy is to rerun the qa script with the option \verb|-nointer|, which will omit an update of the interaction terms in the linearization calculations.
	\item Multiple variables, through the option \verb|-dvid|, is not yet implemented in the report although the relevant models are being estimated.
	\item Automatic addition of interoccasion variability, implemented via \verb|-iov| is not yet functional.
	\item Only parameters associated with an ETA can be used in the \verb|-parameter=| option
    \item All covariates must be available in the dataset and declared in \$INPUT
    \item Missing values for covariates must be coded using -99
    \item Mixture models are not supported
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The SCM requires parameters defined in \verb|-parameter=P| to be associated with the corresponding ETA in the format P=f(ETA(x)), i.e. where the ETA is on the left-hand side of the equation defining the parameter. Parameters need to be defined in \$PK or \$PRED, not \$ERROR.

	\item There is no support in the QA version of SCM to handle multi-category covariates. A work-around is to define them as either continuous or as multiple bivariate covariates. The latter would require changes to the dataset. Naturally the QA investigation could be made more focused by not including these covariates in the evaluation by omitting them in the \verb|-categorical_covariates| option.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{FREM}
\begin{itemize}
	\item For time-varying covariates, only the baseline value will be used.
	\item For multiple categorical covariates, missing combinations may make the model unstable. Such aan example would be the bivariate covariates SEX and GENOTYPE, with the category female-PM missing.
	\item A fixed omega is not allowed in the model if there are non-fixed omegas both before and after it
\end{itemize}
