The following options control the messages printed to screen during the run. They do not affect the final results in any way.
\begin{optionlist}
\optname{display\_iterations}
Default not set.  This option turns on display the iterations output from NONMEM during the model run. If the option is not set, the iterations output will be redirected to a file (nmfe\_output.txt). As with any option the user can choose to change the default by editing psn.conf, see the document psn\_configuration.pdf. The option can be disabled with -no-display\_iterations.

The template psn.conf distributed with the PsN installation package has this option set as the default for execute, but not for other tools.  
\nextopt
\optname{silent}
Default not set. The silent option redirects all messages that PsN normally prints to screen to the file run\_messages.txt. Note that messages from NONMEM, such as iterations, will not be printed to run\_messages.txt. Those messages will be in nmfe\_output.txt in the NM\_run subdirectories. Other results and log files are written to disk as usual. Nothing is printed to screen. 
\nextopt
\optname{stop\_motion}
Default not set. Used for debugging. Will cause PsN to pause its execution at certain predefined breakpoints, and only continue after the user hits enter.
\nextopt
\optname{verbose}
Default not set. With verbose set, PsN will print more details to screen about NONMEM runs. More precisely PsN will print the minimization message for each successful run and a R:X for each retry PsN makes of a failed run, where X is the run number. 
\nextopt
\optname{warn\_with\_trace}
Default not set. If -warn\_with\_trace is set, PsN will print a stack trace for all error and warning messages. This is only for developers. 
\nextopt
\end{optionlist}
