PsN can automatically generate R plots to visualize results for \guidetoolname, using a default template found in the R-scripts subdirectory of the installation directory. The user can also create a custom template, see more details in the section Auto-generated R plots from PsN in common\_options.pdf.

\rplotsconditions

\begin{optionlist}
\optdefault{rplots}{level}
-rplots<0 means R-script is not generated\\ 
-rplots=0 (default) means R-script is generated but not run\\ 
-rplots=1 means basic R plots are generated\\													  
-rplots=2 means basic and extended R plots are generated\\													  
\nextopt
\end{optionlist}

\subsubsection*{Troubleshooting}
If no .pdf was generated even if a template file is available and the appropriate options were set, check the .Rout-file in the main run directory for error messages. If no .Rout-file exists, then check that R is properly installed, and that either command 'R' is available or that R is configured in psn.conf.
