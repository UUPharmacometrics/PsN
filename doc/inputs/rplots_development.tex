In the R-scripts folder there is one main template file per PsN tool that supports the R plots option.
The template files have names toolname\_default.R, for example bootstrap\_default.R and randtest\_default.R.
Each template file shall be as concise as possible. All R function definitions shall be in a subfolder of the R-scripts folder, and the subfolder shall be named after the PsN tool, for example pvar.

\begin{description}
\item[TODO]
  Do a simple clean-up of each template file toolname\_default.R so that already existing  R function definitions, if any, are moved
  to new files in subfolders with correct names, and the template file instead sources the new files, in the same way as pvar\_default.R
\item[TODO] Do more extensive clean-up of each template file, rewriting scripts to easily testable functions that return
  data frames etc, plus functions that return plot objects. Like pvar.
\item[TODO] Delete TODO items from the documentation when they are done.
