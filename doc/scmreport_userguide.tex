\section{Summary}
The scmreport script is used for summarizing the results of an scm or scmplus run.
The examples below show output for an scmplus run.
The output of scmreport is a summary of the contents of the scm log file. 
NONMEM output files are not parsed.

{\bfseries Model}\\
The name of the model in the scm log file, which is composed of the parameter, covariate and state number.

{\bfseries N\_test}\\
The number of times, i.e. in how many iterations, 
the parameter-covariate relation has been tested.
%fixme backward counted?

{\bfseries N\_ok}\\
How many times, out of N\_test, does the scm log file list an ofv that such that extended model
has lower ofv than the base model?
%fixme

{\bfseries N\_localmin}\\
How many times, out of N\_test, did the run end in a local minimum, i.e. the log file lists a
higher ofv for the extended model than for the base model?

{\bfseries N\_failed}\\
How many times, out of N\_test, did the scm log file state that the model failed?

{\bfseries StepSelected} \\
In which forward step, if any, was the parameter-covariate relation selected?

{\bfseries StepStashed} \\
Only for scmplus: In which forward step, if any, was the parameter-covariate relation stashed, i.e. removed from the set of relations tested again?

{\bfseries StepReadded} \\
Only for scmplus: In which forward step, if any, was a previously stashed
parameter-covariate relation retested?

{\bfseries BackstepRemoved}\\ 
Both for scm and scmplus: 
In which backward step, if any, was a previously selected parameter-covariate relation removed?

{\bfseries Step}\\
The search direction and the step number in that direction. The last rows list the included relations
at the end of the scm or scmplus run.

{\bfseries covariate}\\
The name of the covariate.

{\bfseries parameter}\\
The name of the parameter.

{\bfseries state}\\
The scm state number.

{\bfseries BASEOFV}\\
Base ofv as read from the scm log file for the step.

{\bfseries NEWOFV}\\
New ofv for the selected model as read from the scm log file for the step.

{\bfseries OFVDROP}\\
Drop between BASEOFV and NEWOFV as read from the scm log file.

{\bfseries dDF}\\
The change in degrees of freedom when going from base model to new model.

{\bfseries PVALrun}\\
The actual p-value, computed based on change in ofv, for choosing the extended model.
In a forward step the new model is the extended model and in a backward step the base model is the extended model.

{\bfseries pvalue}\\
The p-value cutoff for selecting/excluding a relation as read from the scm log file.

\section{Input and options}

\subsection{Required input}
The name of an scm or scmplus run directory is a required argument.

\subsection{Optional input}

\begin{optionlist}
\optname{ofv\_table}
Show ofv etc for selected relations, instead of the default which is
a summary of all tested relations.
\nextopt
\optdefault{decimals}{N}
Only used in combination with option -ofv\_table.
Number of decimals to display for OFV columns. Default is 5.
\nextopt
\optname{toR}
Print results as data frame code. Default not set.
\nextopt
\optname{logfile}
Name of scm logfile in the directory. 
Default is the name of the logfile in
version\_and\_option\_info.txt, 
so normally this option is only needed if version\_and\_option\_info.txt is not present,
or if the entire folder has been moved so that version\_and\_option\_info.txt cannot be used.
\nextopt
\optname{help}
Print help text and exit.
\nextopt
\optname{version}
Print version information and exit.
\end{optionlist}
