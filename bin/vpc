$help_text{Pre_help_message} = <<'EOF';
    Visual Predictive Check.
EOF

    $help_text{Description} = <<'EOF';

    VPC - Visual Predictive Check - is a diagnostics tool. A set of simulated
    datasets are generated using the model to be evaluated. Afterwards the
    real data observations are compared with the distribution of the simulated
    observations. By default no model estimation is ever performed. The input
    to the NPC script is the model to be evaluated, the number of samples
    (simulated datasets) to generate, parameter values options for the
    simulations, and stratification options for the evaluation. It is also
    possible to skip the simulation step entirely by giving two already created
    tablefiles as input. The input to the VPC script is the input to NPC plus
    an additional set of options. A large portion of the processing is
    identical between the scripts.
EOF

$help_text{Examples} = <<'EOF';
    vpc  run32.mod -samples=500 -auto_bin=5 -rplots=1

    Run a vpc with 500 samples using 5 bins and output the plots.
EOF

$help_text{Options} = <<'EOF';

    A modelfile is required, unless option -sim_table and -orig_table are
    both specified. The number of simulated datasets to generate is also
    required, see -samples.

The following options are valid:
EOF

$help_text{-auto_bin} = <<'EOF';
    -auto_bin=auto
    -auto_bin=min,max
    -auto_bin=N
    -auto_bin=unique

    Default is -auto_bin=2,10. Automatic binning constrained to a minimum of
    2 bins and a maximum of 10. The parameter gives how to search for
    the number of bins. Forbidden to use more than one of these combinations.
    * "auto" means to try to estimate the number of bins needed automatically.
    * min,max means to search for the number of bins between min and max,
    e.g. -auto_bin=5,15 If stratification is used it is possible to use
    different min and max values for the different stratas by specifying an
    array here, e.g. -auto_bin=5,15:10,15 If only one pair is specified this
    will be used for all stratas. * A single number forces binning into N
    bins, e.g. -auto_bin=7 If stratification is used it is possible to use
    a different bin count for different stratas by specifying an array here,
    e.g. -auto_bin=5:10:3 If only one value is specified this will be used
    for all stratas.* unique bins on unique values of the indpendent variable.
    This option can be used in conjunction with the min_points_in_bin option
    but not with any other binning options.

    -auto_bin=auto   (default)
    -auto_bin={number of bins} (recommended)
    -auto\_bin={start_range},{stop_range}
    -auto\_bin=unique
    -bin\by\count=0 -bin_array={boundary1,boundary2,...}
    -bin\by_count=1 -bin_array={count1,count2,...}
    -bin\by_count=0 -no_of_bins=X
    -bin\by_count=1 -no_of_bins=X
    -bin\by_count=0 -single_bin_size=X -overlap=Y
    -bin\by_count=1 -single_bin_size=X -overlap=Y
    -bin\by_count=0 -single_bin_size=X
    -bin\by_count=1 -single_bin_size=X
EOF

$help_text{-bin_array} = <<'EOF';
    -bin_array=x1,x2,...

    A comma-separated list of either the number of observations in each    bin
    or the boundaries between bins, depending on whether the option
    -bin_by_count is 1 or 0. If binning is done by count, the list must
    contain at least 2 numbers, otherwise 1 number is enough.If used, the
    option -bin_by_count is required, while all other binning options are
    forbidden. If different values are wanted for different stratas multiple
    arrays can be specified separated with a colon, i.e. 1,2,3:4,5,6.
EOF

$help_text{-bin_by_count} = <<'EOF';
    -bin_by_count= 1 | 0

    Decide whether binning should be done based on the number of observations
    (1) in each bin or the width of the binning interval (0). Required unless
    only the independent variable is specified without any binning options,
    then forbidden.
EOF

$help_text{-boxcox_lambda} = <<'EOF';
    -boxcox_lambda=X

    Setting this variable indicates that data is Box-Cox transformed. Data
    will be transformed to normal scale for eventual prediction correction,
    and retransformed to Box-Cox before analysis and output. Option cannot
    be used with lnDV. The transformation is (DV*lambda+1)**(1/lambda) for
    Box-Cox to normal, and (DV**lambda-1)/lambda for normal to Box-Cox.
EOF

$help_text{-censor} = <<'EOF';
    -censor=VARIABLE

    Default not set. Name of variable which defines whether the observation
    of the dependent variable is missing, e.g. due to drop-out. 1 means the
    observation is censored, 0 means the observation is not censored. The
    variable must be requestable in $TABLE. This option is not applicable
    for time-to-event data, please read the section 'VPC for time-to-event
    models'. This option should not be used for observations that are above
    or below the level of quantification, then options \mbox{-lloq} and
    -uloq should be used in combination with a special simulation model and,
    possibly, a modified input data set, see section Handling BQL data.
EOF

$help_text{-confidence_interval} = <<'EOF';
    -confidence_interval=number

    Default is 95. An integer between 1 and 99 specifying the confidence
    interval in percent.
EOF

$help_text{-copy_data} = <<'EOF';
    -copy_data

    Default set. Disable with -no-copy_data. By default, PsN will copy the
    datafile into NM_run1 and set a local path in psn.mod, the actual modelfile
    run with NONMEM. If -no-copy_data is set, PsN will not copy the data to
    NM_run1 and instead set the absolute path in $DATA in psn.mod. However,
    the absolute path must not be too long, since NONMEM will not accept more
    than 80 characters for the filename in $DATA.
EOF

$help_text{-dv} = <<'EOF';
    -dv=VARIABLE

    Default is DV. If a synonym for DV is set in \mbox{$INPUT}, the synonym
    must be set as the dependent variable on the commandline, -dv=$<$synonym$>$.
    Case sensitive, must be exactly the same case and spelling as in modelfile.
    Maximum of 4 letters because of NONMEM limitation, unless either IPRED or
    IWRES.
EOF
$help_text{-fine_pi} = <<'EOF';
    -fine_pi

    Default not set. Compute a finer grid of prediction intervals. If fine_pi
    is not set, the set of prediction intervals is 0,40,80,90 and 95 percent.
    If fine_pi is set, the set of intervals is 0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90
    and 95 percent.
EOF

$help_text{-flip_comments} = <<'EOF';
    -flip_comments

    By default PsN will create a simulation model based on the required input
    model, but option -flip_comments invokes a method for handling user-defined
    simulation code in the required input model. If option is set, PsN will
    create the simulation model by flipping comments (commented lines will
    be uncommented and vice versa) between the tags. Cannot be used together
    with -sim_model, -keep_estimation or -noprediction.
    ;Sim_start
    and
    ;Sim_end
    For example, if the required input model has the lines
    ;Sim_start
    IGNORE(TYPE.EQ.1)
    ;ACCEPT(TYPE.EQ.1)
    ;Sim_end
    then the MAXEVAL=0 model will be run as such and the simulation model
    will instead have lines

    ;IGNORE(TYPE.EQ.1)
    ACCEPT(TYPE.EQ.1)

    The tags may appear multiple times. Note that the tags must look exactly
    as above or the editing will fail. When creating the simulation model
    PsN will remove $COV and $TABLE, change SEED and NSUBS in $SIM, add a
    new $TABLE and  update initial estimates if option -lst_file is set or
    add $MSFI if option -msfo_file is used, but otherwise no changes will be
    made to the code. See section Modified models.
EOF

$help_text{-idv} = <<'EOF';
    -idv=VARIABLE

    Default is TIME, the independent variable to bin on. Specific for VPC.
    (old  option was -bin_on, without default value)
EOF

$help_text{-in_filter} = <<'EOF';
    -in_filter=comma-separated list of conditions

    Default not set. Only relevant in combination with -rawres_input. The
    parameter estimates lines in the file can be filtered on values in the
    different columns. When specifying which column(s) the filtering should
    be based on, the exact column name must be used, e.g. minimization_successful.
    Filtering can only be based on columns with numeric values. The allowed
    relations are .gt. (greater than), .lt. (less than) and .eq. (equal to).
    If the value in the filter column is 'NA' then that parameter set will be
    skipped, regardless of the defined filter relation. Conditions are
    separated with commas. If the remaining number of lines after filtering
    is smaller than -samples, the program will stop with an error message.
    Then the user must either change the filtering rules or change -samples.
    If the user has created a file with parameter estimates outside of PsN,
    filtering can be done on any numeric column in that file. Do not set
    column headers containing .eq. or .lt. or .gt.in the user-generated file
    as this would interfere with the in_filter option syntax.
    Example:
    -in_filter=minimization_successful.eq.1,significant_digits.gt.3.5
EOF

$help_text{-irep} = <<'EOF';
    -irep=VARIABLE

    When both -orig_table and -sim_table are used, option -irep may be used
    to give the header of the -sim_table column that contains the number of
    the current simulation replication, variable IREP in NONMEM. This option
    should only be used when -sim_table has a single header at the beginning
    of the file, not when -sim_table has one header per simulated dataset.
When -sim_table and -orig_table are not used, this option will cause PsN to
add the given variable to the simulated table, which requires the user to
have defined it in the input (simulation) model, but the variable will be
ignored in the analysis.
EOF

$help_text{-keep_estimation} = <<'EOF';
    -keep_estimation

    Default not set. If this option is set, a post-hoc evaluation step is
    performed for each simulated dataset (\mbox{$ESTIMATION} is kept and
    MAXEVALS is set to 0). Note that in this case variables such as IPRED(F)
    are based on the re-estimated post-hoc parameters. Also note that in
    earlier program versions keep_estimation was set or unset automatically.
EOF

$help_text{-levels} = <<'EOF';
    -levels=level1,level2,...

    The boundaries for a categorization. Category 1 $leq$ number1 $<$ category
    2 $leq$ number2, etc. Specific for VPC.
EOF

$help_text{-lloq} = <<'EOF';
    -lloq=number

    The lower limit of quantification for left censored data. Specific for
    VPC.
EOF

$help_text{-lnDV} = <<'EOF';
    -lnDV=0, 1, 2 or 3

    Default 0. Mainly for use with -predcorr. lnDV=0 or 1 or 3 may be used
    without setting -predcorr, but -lnDV=2 is only allowed together with
    predcorr. Variable to indicate if the dependent variable is log-transformed
    (ln(DV)) or not and how that should be handled. lnDV=0 Default. No
    exponentiation of DV will be performed. When used in combination with
    -predcorr -lnDV=0 indicates that DV is untransformed. lnDV=1 DV and PRED
    values will be exponentiated. Indicates log-transformed DV and that VPC
    results should be presented on normal scale. May be used without setting
    -predcorr. lnDV=2 Only allowed in combination with -predcorr. Indicates
    log-transformed DV that should be maintained. lnDV=3 DV and PRED values
    will be log-transformed. May be used without setting \mbox{-predcorr}.
EOF

$help_text{-lower_bound} = <<'EOF';
    -lower_bound=number or variable

    Only allowed together with option -predcorr, and when lnDV= 0 or 1. Value
    can be either    a number or an independent variable present in $INPUT or
    defined in the modelfile.
EOF

$help_text{-lst_file} = <<'EOF';
    -lst_file=file

    Not allowed together with -msfo_file. Use final parameter estimates from
    this lst-file for the simulation. By default PsN will look for a file with
    the same name as the regular input model, or the simulation model if option
    -sim_model is used, but with suffix .lst instead of .mod. If such a file
    is found then option -lst_file=$<$modelfile$>$.lst is set automatically.
    VPC does not perform estimation.
EOF

$help_text{-min_points_in_bin} = <<'EOF';
    -min_points_in_bin=N

    Default is 10. Used only if -auto_bin (except -auto_bin=unique) is selected.
    Set to disallow bins of size smaller than N. This option cannot be used in
    conjunction with any other binning options.
EOF

$help_text{-mirrors} = <<'EOF';
    -mirrors=number

    The number of mirror plot data sets to produce. Specific VPC.
EOF

$help_text{-mix} = <<'EOF';
    -mix

    Set to perform a mixture vpc.
EOF

$help_text{-msfo_file} = <<'EOF';
    -msfo_file=filename

    If the model has a $NONP record then an msfo-file is required, otherwise
    optional. Use final parameter estimates from msfo-file instead of initial
    estimates from modelfile when simulating. VPC does not perform estimation.
EOF

$help_text{-n_simulation_models} = <<'EOF';
    -n_simulation_models=number

    Default is 1 which means all simulations are run in the same modelfile.
    By setting this option to a number N greater than 1, the 'samples'
    simulations will be split equally between N model files, which can be run
    in parallel. This option cannot be used together with option
    \mbox{-sim_table} or, if the NONMEM version $<$ 7, together with -dv=CWRES.
    Important: Two runs will give different results if -n_simulation_models
    are set to different numbers even if the -seed option is the same. This
    is because the random number generator of NONMEM will change state when
    reading the seed from the $SIM record from a new simulation modelfile.
    This state change does not occur when NONMEM simply continues simulating
    from the same modelfile.
EOF

$help_text{-no_of_bins} = <<'EOF';
    -no_of_bins=number

    Number of bins of approximately equal size to create. The number must be
    larger than 1. If used, the option -bin_by_count is required, while all
    other binning options are forbidden.
EOF

$help_text{-no_of_strata} = <<'EOF';
    -no_of_strata=number

    Only allowed together with -stratify_on. An integer requesting the number
    of strata. The number must be equal to or less than the number of unique
    values of the stratification variable. If the number is smaller than the
    number of unique values, the observations will be grouped so that the
    number of observations in each group/strata is approximately equal.
EOF

$help_text{-noprediction} = <<'EOF';
    -noprediction

    Default not set. If set, NOPREDICTION will be added to the $SIMULATION
    record of the simulation model, in addition to ONLYSIMULATION. This
    option is generally recommended with likelihood models for odd type data
    (i.e. -2LOGLIKELIHOOD or LIKELIHOOD in $ESTIMATION). It is not allowed
    to use -noprediction in combination with the option \mbox{-keep_estimation}.
EOF

$help_text{-offset_rawres} = <<'EOF';
    -offset_rawres=number

    Default 1. Only relevant in combination with -rawres_input. The number
    of result lines to skip in the input raw results file before starting to
    read final parameter estimates. In a regular bootstrap raw_results file
    the first line of estimates refers to the input model with the full
    dataset, so therefore the default offset is 1.
EOF

$help_text{-orig_table} = <<'EOF';
    -orig_table=filename

    Give tablefile with original data as input directly instead of letting
    the program generate them.The file must have a header, the first column
    must be ID and the file must be space separated. This option can only
    be used together with -sim_table.
EOF

$help_text{-overlap_percent} = <<'EOF';
    -overlap_percent=Y

    An integer specifying the percent overlap between consecutive bins. If
    used, the options -bin_by_count and -single_bin_size are required, while
    all other binning options are forbidden.
EOF

$help_text{-predcorr} = <<'EOF';
    -predcorr

    Perform prediction correction of dependent variable values. Specific for
    VPC. If the dependent variable is log transformed or has a lower bound
    not equal to 0 it can be important to specify the optional variables
    -lnDV and lower_bound. The predcorr feature will not work well if there
    is an upper bound, e.g. when the dependent variable is logit transformed.
EOF

$help_text{-rawres_input} = <<'EOF';
    -rawres_input=filename

    A simple way to simulate with uncertainty. Instead of using identical
    parameter estimates for simulation of each new dataset, take parameter
    estimates from a raw_results.csv file, e.g. from a bootstrap run or the
    intial_estimates.csv file from a previous sse run with $PRIOR in the
    simulation model. The raw results file must be comma-separated and
    contain at least as many samples as the input -samples to sse, the
    labels for THETA/OMEGA/SIGMA in the file must match the labels in the
    simulation model given as input to sse, the theta columns must be
    directly followed by the omega columns which must be directly followed
    by the sigma columns, and the column header must be model either in the
    first column just as in a bootstrap raw_results file or in the second
    or third column as in a sse raw_results file. If a column header contains
    a comma, e.g. OMEGA(2,2), then that header must be enclosed in double
    quotes. This is done automatically in PsN raw results files. Note that
    it is possible to generate a file with initial parameter estimates
    outside of PsN, as long as the file follows the format rules.
EOF

$help_text{-refcorr} = <<'EOF';
    -refcorr

    Perform reference correction on dependent variable values before computing
    vpc results. The option takes a comma separated list of equals separated pairs
    of column names and reference values.
    Cannot be used together with -predcorr or -varcorr.
EOF

$help_text{-refcorr_data} = <<'EOF';
    -refcorr_data

    Option to specify a custom reference dataset to be used for reference simulations
    when doing reference correction. The dataset needs to have a REF column containing the 
    row number (starting with 1) of the original dataset. Can only be used together with the -refcorr
    options.
EOF

$help_text{-refcorr_idv} = <<'EOF';
    -refcorr_idv

    Set this option to also reference correct the variable set as idv via the -idv option.
EOF

$help_text{-refstrat} = <<'EOF';
    -refstrat=number

    Only allowed together with -stratify_on. Not allowed together with
    -no_of_strata. A number indicating the value of the stratification variable
    in the reference stratum used when computing delta-means.
EOF

$help_text{-samples} = <<'EOF';
    -samples=number

    The number of simulated datasets to generate is required. 20 is the
    minimum accepted value.
EOF

$help_text{-sim_model} = <<'EOF';
    -sim_model=filename

    Cannot be used together with -flip_comments, \mbox{-keep_estimation} or
    -noprediction. By default PsN will create a simulation model based on the
    required input model, but by using option -sim_model it is possible to
    use a separate input model for the simulations. PsN will remove $COV and
    \mbox{$TABLE}, change SEED and NSUBS in $SIM, add a new \mbox{$TABLE}
    and  update initial estimates if option -lst_file is set or add $MSFI
    if option -msfo_file is used, but otherwise no changes will be made to
    the user defined simulation model. See section Modified models. Note that
    -lst_file will be set automatically if a file with the same name as the
    regular input model but with suffix lst intead of mod is found.
EOF

$help_text{-sim_table} = <<'EOF';
    -sim_table=filename or comma-separated list of filenames

    Only allowed when -orig_table is also used. Give file(s) with simulated
    data as input directly instead of letting the program generate them.
    The file must have a header, the first column must be ID and the file
    must be space separated. Either each simulation dataset must have a new
    header, as when the file is generated with $TABLE in NONMEM with NSUBS>0,
    or option -irep must be used.
EOF

$help_text{-single_bin_size} = <<'EOF';
    -single_bin_size=X

    A scalar specifying the size of individual bins. The number either
    specifies the number of observations in each bin or the width of the
    binning interval, depending on whether the option -bin_by_count is 1 or 0.
    If used, the option -bin_by_count is required and -overlap_percent is
    optional, while all other binning options are forbidden.
EOF

$help_text{-stratify_on} = <<'EOF';
    -stratify_on=VARIABLE

    Variable to stratify on. The variable must be independent, i.e. be the
    same for all simulations of a particular observation. VPC will stratify
    the data on unique values of the specified variable, and perform separate
    analyses on each set. Stratification may also be done on parameter
    defined in the model. The stratification variable must be requestable
    in $TABLE. -stratify_on may be a comma-separated list of multiple
    variables, then the first variable will be used for stratification
    and the rest simply added to $TABLE. Note that is is not possible to
    stratify on a variable that differs between simulations.
EOF

$help_text{-tte} = <<'EOF';
    -tte=VARIABLE

    An optional argument, but it is required to assume (repeated) time-to-event
    type models. Cannot be used together with option -mirror, -censor,
    -predcorr, -varcorr,  -lnDV, -uloq, -lloq or -boxcox_lambda. The tte-
    variable needs to be defined in the simulation model and must take the
    value 0 if the observation is not an event and non-zero if it is an event
    (including events and censored events). PsN will add the tte-variable to
    \mbox{$TABLE} of the simulation model (not the original data model). PsN
    will format the output differently compared to a regular vpc, to
    specifically suit the kaplan.plot functionality in Xpose (e.g. filtering
    of simulation output based on tte-variable).
EOF

$help_text{-uloq} = <<'EOF';
    -uloq=number

    The upper limit of quantification for right censored data. Specific for VPC.
EOF

$help_text{-varcorr} = <<'EOF';
    -varcorr

    Perform variability correction on dependent variable values before computing
