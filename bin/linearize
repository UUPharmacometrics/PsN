    Linearization of a model.

    The linearize tool allows you to automatically create a linearized version
    of a model and obtain the dataset including individual predictions and
    derivatives necessary for further estimation of extensions implemented in
    the linearized model.
    The linearization was developed with the aim to facilitate the development
    of nonlinear mixed effects models by establishing a diagnostic method for
    evaluation of stochastic model components. A full description of the
    methodology and its performance is presented in "Use of a linearization
    approximation facilitating stochastic model building", J PKPD (2014) EM
    Svensson and MO Karlsson.

    The online supplementary material includes a comprehensive code example.
    The methodology utilizes first order Taylor expansions and substantially
    shortens run times. Examples of extensions that can be evaluated with the
    linearized model are addition of inter individual or inter occasion variability
    parameters, correlation structures and more complex residual error models.

    Before proceeding with implementation and evaluation of extensions, it is
    important to check that the OFV value of the nonlinear and linearized version
    of the base model agrees (printed in the command window and in the linlog.txt
    file generated in the linearization folder). If the OFV-values differ more
    than a few points, this can depend on the occurrence of local minima in the
    MAP estimation. See further information in linerize_userguide.pdf.

$help_text{Options} = <<'EOF';
    A model file is required on the command line.

    The following options are valid, but intended only for research and method
    exploration. It is recommended not to use them:
EOF

$help_text{-h} = <<'EOF';
    -h | -?

    With -h or -? linearize will print a list of options and exit.
EOF

$help_text{-help} = <<'EOF';
    -help

    With -help linearize will print this, longer, help message.
EOF

$help_text{-epsilon} = <<'EOF';
-epsilon

    Default set. Linearize with respect to epsilons, Disable with -no-epsilon.
EOF

$help_text{-error} = <<'EOF';
    -error=add | prop | propadd

    Only relevant if -no-epsilon is set. Use an approximated linearization of
    the error model instead of an exact. Alternatives are;
    add    (for additive)
    prop (for proportional)
    propadd (for proportional plus additive)

    The error model must be defined in a particular way when this option is used,
    see the scm user guide for details.
EOF

$help_text{-foce} = <<'EOF';
    -foce

    Default set. Expand around conditional ETA estimates instead of around ETA=0.
EOF

$help_text{-keep_covariance} = <<'EOF';
    -keep_covariance

    The default setting will delete $COVARIANCE from the bootstrap models, to
    save run time. If option -keep_covariance is set, PsN will instead keep
    $COVARIANCE.
EOF

$help_text{-nointer} = <<'EOF';
    -nointer

    Default off. Don't use interaction.
EOF

$help_text{-second_order} = <<'EOF';
    -second_order

    Default off. Use second order (laplace) approximation.
EOF
