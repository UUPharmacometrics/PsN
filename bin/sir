    The sir (sampling importance resampling) tool calculates uncertainty on
    model parameters for the input model. Application of Sampling Importance
    Resampling to estimate parameter uncertainty distributions, PAGE 22 (2013)
    Abstr 2907, Dosne AG, Bergstrand M, Karlsson MO.
    The output of the sir procedure is a set of parameter vectors representing
    the uncertainty around model parameters, just like a bootstrap. Confidence
    intervals around the parameters are also computed, based on this set of
    parameter vectors.The sir procedure gets to the final set of parameter
    vectors via N successive iterations. Each iteration consists of 3 steps.

    First, M parameter vectors are simulated from a proposal uncertainty.
    Then, for each parameter vector, an importance ratio IR (representing
    how well the vector represents the uncertainty) is calculated.
    Finally, m parameter vectors (m<M) are then resampled from the M
    simulated vectors based on these IR. They are called the “posterior” or
    sir uncertainty. This is the end of an iteration. In the next iteration,
    the m parameter vectors are then used     as the new proposal uncertainty,
    and a new set of M parameter vectors are simulated from this new proposal.

    IR are evaluated for the new set of parameter vectors and m vectors are
    resampled based on their IR. In practice, the number of samples (M) and
    resamples (m) can vary between iterations. The procedure should be
    repeated until there is no change between the proposal uncertainty and
    the posterior uncertainty, meaning that the sir procedure has converged
    to the true uncertainty.

    Because the number of iterations is chosen by the user, diagnostics plots
    have been developed to assess whether this number of iterations was enough
    for sir to converge, and these can be generated via the -rplots option,
    see section Diagnostic sir plots.

    First, parameter vectors will be simulated from the truncated multivariate
    normal distribution given by the covariance matrix output from NONMEM’s
    covariance step (or, if NONMEM’s covariance step was not successful, a
    faked NONMEM covariance matrix). Alternatively, a file with simulated
    parameter vectors can be given directly as input and this simulation is
    skipped. The last approach is useful when it is difficult to obtain a
    (faked) covariance matrix.

    Second, each of the simulated parameter vectors will be evaluated on the
    original data (MAXEVAL=0).

    Third, based on these evaluations, weights will be calculated for each
    of the parameter vectors and the vectors will be resampled according to
    these weights.

    Finally, the uncertainty covariance matrix of the parameters will be
    computed from the resampled parameter vectors.

    IR are evaluated for the new set of parameter vectors and m vectors are
    resampled based on their IR. In practice, the number of samples (M) and
    resamples (m) can vary between iterations. The procedure should be
    repeated until there is no change between the proposal uncertainty and
    the posterior uncertainty, meaning that the sir procedure has converged
    to the true uncertainty.

    Because the number of iterations is chosen by the user, diagnostics plots
    have been developed to assess whether this number of iterations was enough
    for sir to converge, and these can be generated via the -rplots option,
    see section Diagnostic sir plots in the sir user guide.

EOF

$help_text{Options} = <<'EOF';

    A model file is required on the command line. If output file (lst) exists,
    then it is important that the control stream copy at the top of the
    lst-file matches the actual input model file in terms of which parameters
    are present and which parameters are FIXED or SAME.

    The following options are valid:
EOF

$help_text{-add_iterations} = <<'EOF';
    -add_iterations

    Default not set. Iterations can be added to a previous sir run, for
    example if the diagnostic R plots show that convergence has not been
    achieved. When option -add_iterations is set, option -directory is
    required,and this directory must contain output from at least one complete
    sir iteration.

    The options set on the command line pertain to new iterations with the
    last available iteration as starting point. Options -covmat_input and
    -rawres_input are forbidden    in combination with -add_iterations, the model
    file does not have to be specified (it will be ignored if it is), otherwise
    the same sir options are required/optional as in a regular sir run.

    If some but not all iterations from the previous run had finished, the
    new run    will start with the output from the last complete iteration, and
    the old sample and resample counts for the non-finished iterations will
    be dropped. Example: if the old setting was -samples=1000,1000 and the new
    with -add_iterations is -samples=2000,2000 and the old run was terminated
    after the first iteration, then after the add\_iterations run has finished
    there will be three iterations in total with sample sequence 1000,2000,2000
    after the new run has finished.
EOF

$help_text{-auto_rawres} = <<'EOF';
    -auto_rawres=degree

    Default not set. Not allowed in combination with covmat_input. If
    rawres_input is not set, this option will make sir use the tweak_inits
    functionality to automatically create a rawres_input file with perturbed
    parameter vectors, and these vectors will then be used as if read from a
    real raw_results file. The generation of perturbed parameter vector i,
    element j, is performed according to init_ij = init_0j + rand_uniform
    (-degree*init_0j,+degree*init_0j) where init_0j is the final estimate of
    parameter j$in the input model. The tweaking procedure makes sure that
    boundary conditions, including positive definiteness of $OMEGA and $SIGMA,
    are respected. If option -auto_rawres is used in combination with
    rawres_input, tweak_inits by 'degree' will be used to augment the given
    rawres\_input file until the matrix has full rank, see help text for
    -rawres_input.
EOF


$help_text{-boxcox} = <<'EOF';
    -boxcox

    Default set. If option is set, sir will Box-Cox transform parameter
    vectors before computing the covariance matrix used for sampling. If
    option is unset using -no-boxcox, no transformation will be performed
    before computing covariance matrix used for sampling.
EOF

$help_text{-cap_correlation} = <<'EOF';
    -cap_correlation=X

    Default is 0.8. If set to a number between 0 and 1, at every iteration
    ensure that no absolute value of a correlation in the proposal exceeds
    this number. If some do, they will be changed to X (or -X if negative).
    To turn off this feature, set -cap_correlation=1, which in practice
    means no capping.
EOF

$help_text{-cap_resampling} = <<'EOF';
    -cap_resampling=N

    Default is 1. The maximum number of times a single parameter vector can
    be resampled in each iteration. Value 1 means regular sampling without
    replacement. A value equal to the maximum value of the 'resamples' array
    will give unlimited replacement, but this is not recommended. Any value
    in between gives limited replacement.
EOF

$help_text{-copy_data} = <<'EOF';
    -copy_data

    Default set, can be unset with -no-copy_data. By default, the original
    dataset will be copied to the sir run directory to be used for relevant
    runs. If -no-copy_data is set, the absolute path to the original data
    will be used instead. This saves disk space.
EOF

$help_text{-covmat_input} = <<'EOF';
    -covmat_input=filename

    Not allowed together with rawres_input or auto_rawres. If given, this
    covariance matrix is used in iteration 1 for sampling parameter vectors
    and for computing the PDF. The matrix will not be used in any but the
    first iteration. If the user wants to input an identity matrix, it is
    not necessary to create the .cov-file.
    Instead set option -covmat_input=identity. Option -covmat_input=identity
    an be combined with inflation to get any diagonal covariance matrix
    without creating the .cov-file. If a file is used, the format of the file
    is similar to a NONMEM-generated .cov-file except that the TABLE NO. line
    should be omitted. Fixed parameters do not have to be omitted, sir will
    filter them out. The covmat_input file must be formatted to contain a
    space- or tab-separated  N x N symmetric covariance matrix. The first line
    in the file must be a header with labels for THETA/OMEGA/SIGMA written as
    in a regular NONMEM .cov-file and a leading column called NAME: NAME THETA1
    THETA2 ... SIGMA(1,1) ... OMEGA(1,1) ...
    The NAME column contains the same parameter labels (to identify the rows).
    The rows and columns must be sorted with THETAs first. Please note that
    the PsN tool covmat that can be used to generate a covariance matrix from
    a raw_results file.
EOF

$help_text{-fast_posdef_checks} = <<'EOF';
    -fast_posdef_checks

    Default not set. Option enables experimental fast positive semi-
    definiteness checks via cholesky. Option enables experimental fast
    positive semi-definiteness checks via cholesky decomposition. By default
    sampler uses eigenvalue decomposition (to get subspace which constitute
    valid covariance matrices) which in some cases can be several orders of
    magnitude slower (especially with large matrices). Try this if large
    covariance matrix and large rejection rate slows down sir.
EOF

$help_text{-in_filter} = <<'EOF';
    -in_filter=comma-separated list of conditions

    Default not set. Only relevant in combination with rawres_input. The
    parameter estimates lines in the file can be filtered on values in the
    different columns. When specifying which column(s) the filtering should
    be based on, the exact column name must be used, e.g.
    minimization_successful. Filtering can only be based on columns with
    numeric values. The allowed relations are .gt. (greater than), .lt. (less
    than) and .eq. (equal to). Conditions are separated with commas. If the
    remaining number of lines after filtering is smaller than -samples, sir
    will stop with an error message. Then the user must either change the
    filtering rules or change -samples. If the user has created a file with
    parameter estimates outside of PsN, filtering can be done on any numeric
    column in that file. Do not set column headers containing .eq. or .lt.
    or .gt.in the user-generated file as this would interfere with the in_filter
    option syntax.

    Example: -in_filter=minimization_successful.eq.1,significant_digits.gt.3.5
EOF

$help_text{-mceta} = <<'EOF';
    -mceta=N

    Only allowed when NONMEM 7.3 or later and a classical estimation method
    is used. Set MCETA=N in $ESTIMATION.
EOF

$help_text{-offset_rawres} = <<'EOF';
    -offset_rawres=N

    Default is 1. Only relevant in combination with rawres_input. The number
    of result lines to skip in the input raw results file before starting to
    read final parameter estimates. In a regular bootstrap raw_results file,
    and also in an initial_estimates.csv file from an sse run, the first line
    of estimates refers to the input model with the full dataset, so therefore
    the default offset is 1.
EOF

$help_text{-omega_inflation} = <<'EOF';
    -Äomega_inflation=X

    Default is the scalar 1, which is the same as no inflation. Either a
    positive vector with length equal to the number of estimated (not FIX)
    $OMEGA diagonal elements #, both diagonal # and off-diagonal, or a
    positive scalar which will be interpreted as a vector of the required
    length and all equal values. If given, the varianceof each estimated
    $OMEGA element    will in the first iteration be inflated with the factor
    from the inflation vector before the parameter vectors are sampled from
    the truncated multivariate normal distribution. Inflation for off-
    diagonal elements will be automatically computed based on inflation for
    diagonals so that the correlation is unchanged. The weights will also be
    computed based the inflated covariance matrix. Inflation is not used in any but
    the first iteration.
EOF

$help_text{-print_iter} = <<'EOF';
    -print_iter=N

    Default is 0 (off). Every N:th (multivariate normal sampling) iteration
    will be printed with cumulative acceptance and rejection rates.
EOF

$help_text{-problems_per_file} = <<'EOF';
    -problems_per_file=N

    Default is 100. The number of $PROBLEM per model file when running
    MAXEVAL=0 or similar to get ofv:s for parameter vectors. Setting a higher
    value decreases the time overhead involved in running each control stream, but
    increases the risk of losing many samples in case a model file crashes. It
    can also drastically increase the disk space needed for each NONMEM run as the
    dataset in most cases becomes duplicated in the FDATA file.
    Setting -problems_per_file=1 gives maximum robustness to individual
    crashes, but also maximum overhead cost.
EOF

$help_text{-rawres_input} = <<'EOF';
    rawres_input=filename

    If rawres_input is given, sir will run an intial 0th iteration in which
    sir will read all parameter vectors from this file, starting on line
    offset_rawres+1 and skipping any that does not fulfill the filter rules,
    if set. These vectors will be Box-Cox transformed and used to create a
    proposal density for the next iteration. This option is not allowed
    together with covmat_input.

    If the number of vectors read is smaller than the number of estimated
    parameters (also counting off-diagonals), it is not possible to obtain
    an empirical covariance matrix with full rank. In this case sir will
    append copies of the existing vectors, perturbed using the tweak_inits
    functionality, until the resulting set ov vectors has full rank. If option
    -auto_rawres=degree is set on the command-line, tweak_inits will be done
    by 'degree', otherwise the default degree 0.1 will be used for tweaking.
    If $N$ parameter vectors are read from the rawres file, the generation
    of perturbed parameter vector i, element j, is performed according to
    init_ij = init_kj + rand_uniform(-degree*init_kj,+degree*init_kj)
    Where k=i modulo N and init_kj is the value of parameter j in original
    rawres vector k.

    The labels for  THETA/OMEGA/SIGMA in the file must match the labels in
    the model given as input to sir, the theta columns must be directly
    followed by the omega columns which must be directly followed by the
    sigma columns, and the first or second column must have header model.
    Note that is is possible to generate a file with initial parameter
    estimates outside of PsN, as long as the file follows the format rules.
EOF

$help_text{-recenter} = <<'EOF';
    -recenter

    Default set. If option is set and any sampled parameter vector has a
    smaller ofv than the original vector mu of final parameter estimates
    of the input model, then the mu-vector will be replaced with the sampled
    parameter vector with the smallest ofv. If option is unset using
    -no-recenter, the original parameter vector will be kept and a warning
    will be printed that some vectors had a negative delta-ofv.
EOF
$help_text{-resamples} = <<'EOF';
    -resamples=m1,m2

    Default is 200,400,500,1000,1000. A comma-separated list of integers,
    the number of parameter vectors to resample in each iteration based on
    the weights computed from delta ofv and the pdf. List length must be
    equal to list -samples.
EOF

$help_text{-rse_omega} = <<'EOF';
    -rse_omega=X

    Default not set. Used for giving the proposal density as RSE%, e.g. 30
    for 30% RSE. Not allowed in combination with -inflation, -covmat_input,
    -rawres_input or -auto_rawres. Either a positive vector with length equal
    to the number of estimated (not FIX) $OMEGA diagonal elements or a
    positive scalar which will be interpreted as a vector of the required
    length and all equal values. When this option is used, the variances of
    omega(i,i) in the proposal density will be computed as
    (rse_omega(i,i)*(final estimate omega (i,i))/100)^2
    The variances of off-diagonal elements will be computed so that the
    correlation from the final estimate is unchanged. If -rse_theta is set
    to a scalar when option -rse_omega is not used, -rse_omega will
    automatically be set to the same scalar as -rse_theta. If -rse_theta is
    set to a vector and -rse_omega is not set at all, or if -rse_omega is
    set when -rse_theta is not, then there will be an error message.See
    example in sir user guide.
EOF

$help_text{-rse_sigma} = <<'EOF';
    -rse_sigma=X

    Default not set. See help text for -rse_omega.
EOF


$help_text{-rse_theta} = <<'EOF';
    -rse_theta=X

    Default not set. Used for giving the proposal density as RSE%, e.g. 30
    for 30% RSE. Not allowed in combination with -inflation, -covmat_input,
    -rawres_input or -auto_rawres. Either a positive vector with length equal
    to the number of estimated (not FIX) $THETAs, or a positive scalar which
    will be interpreted as a vector of the appropriate length and all equal
    values. When this option is used, the variances of theta(i) in the
    proposal density will be computed as
    (rse_theta(i)*(final estimate theta (i))/100)^2
EOF

$help_text{-samples} = <<'EOF';
    -samples=M1,M2

    Default 1000,1000,1000,2000,2000. A comma-separated list of integers,
    the number of parameter vectors to generate in each iteration. In each
    iteration the number needs to be greater than the number of resamples,
    unless sampling is with replacement.
EOF

$help_text{-sigma_inflation} = <<'EOF';
    -sigma_inflation=X
    See help text for omega_inflation.
EOF

$help_text{-theta_inflation} = <<'EOF';
    -theta_inflation=X

    Default is the scalar 1, which is the same as no inflation.Either a
    positive vector with length equal to the number of estimated (not FIX)
    $THETAs, or a positive scalar which will be interpreted as a vector of
    lenght n($THETA) and all equal values. If given, the variance of each
    estimated $THETA will in the first iteration be inflated with the factor
    from the inflation vector before the parameter vectors are sampled from
    he truncated multivariate normal distribution. The weights will also be
    computed based the inflated covariance matrix. Inflation is not used in
    any but the first iteration.
