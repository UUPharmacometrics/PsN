$help_text{Description} = <<'EOF';

    The benchmark tool is intended for systematic comparison of run times, ofv
	and parameter estimates across NONMEM versions and/or alternative settings
	of NONMEM options.
	For each model file given on the command-line, PsN will create one copy for
	each possible combination of the modifications listed on the command line
	(option -record_options), and then each model copy will be run first with
	the nonmem version given with option -nm_version (as with any PsN tool) and
	then also with each of the nonmem versions listed with option -alt_nonmem
	(if any).
	Each model run will be repeated if option -replicates is set larger than 1.
EOF

$help_text{Pre_help_message} = <<'EOF';
	benchmark tool for systematic comparisons of NONMEM runs.
EOF

$help_text{Examples} = <<'EOF';
	benchmark run1.mod run2.mod -nm_version=nm74alpha -record_options=estimation:none,FAST

	benchmark run3.mod -nm_version=nm73gfortran4 -alt_nonmem=nm73gfortran5 -merge_rawreults
EOF
$help_text{Options} = <<'EOF';
	A model file is required on the command-line.

	Also, there must additional options resulting in at least two NONMEM runs
	that can be compared. This can be achieved by setting at least one
	alternative NONMEM version or at least one record modification listed,
	or giving at least two model files as input and setting option
	-merge_rawresults.

    The following options are valid:
EOF

$help_text{-h} = <<'EOF';
    -h | -?

	With -h or -? benchmark will print a list of options and exit.
EOF

$help_text{-help} = <<'EOF';
    -help

	With -help benchmark will print this, longer, help message.
EOF

$help_text{-alt_nonmem} = <<'EOF';
    -alt_nonmem=comma-separated list

	A comma-separated list of NONMEM versions, as named in psn.conf to run all,
	possibly modified, models with **in addition to** the NONMEM version set
	with PsN common option -nm_version. If different compilers for the same
	NONMEM version are to be compared, then the same NONMEM version compiled
	with different compilers must be listed with different names in psn.conf,
	since PsN does not ``know'' about compilers.
EOF

$help_text{-copy_data} = <<'EOF';
	-copy_data

	Default set. Disable with -no-copy_data. By default, PsN will copy the
	data file into NM_run1 and set a local path in psn.mod, the actual
	modelfile run with NONMEM. If -no-copy_data is set, PsN will not copy the
	data to NM_run1 and instead set a global path to the datafile in psn.mod.
	However, NONMEM will not accept a path longer than 80 characters.
EOF

#$help_text{-dofv_threshold} = <<'EOF';
#   -dofv_threshold=X
#
#   Default 1 (percent). If the relative difference between the ofv of two
#	model runs in the same raw\_results file is greater than this threshold,
#	these models will be flagged in an extra column in the raw\_results file.
#EOF

#$help_text{-parameter_threshold} = <<'EOF';
#   -parameter_threshold=X
#
#   Default 5 (percent). If the relative difference between the parameter
#	estimates of two model runs in the same raw\_results file is greater than
#	this threshold, these models will be flagged in an extra column in the
#	raw\_results file.
#EOF

$help_text{-merge_rawresults} = <<'EOF';
    -merge_rawresults

	Default not set. The default is to create a separate raw_results file for
	each input model, where results for all the variants resulting from
	-record_options and -alt_nonmem are collected. Creating separate
	raw_results files for each input model is done because it cannot be assumed
	that the models and sets of population parameters are the same and
	comparable, so an investigation of the stability of e.g. parameter
	estimates across different input models is not meaningful and the headers
	in the raw_results file can be completely wrong for some models.
	However, the user can choose to override the default procedure with option
	-merge_rawresults, resulting in all runs being reported in the same
	raw_results file, and the rplots processing being performed for all models
	as a single group.
EOF

$help_text{-record_options} = <<'EOF';
    -record_options=list

	Default not set.
	A structured list of the control stream records to modify, and the options
	to set. The record names can be abbreviated and written in lower or upper
	case, as long as they are correct abbreviations of the complete record
	names.
	For example: estimation, EST and estim are correct while ESIMATION is wrong.
	After the record name there must be colon (:), and then a comma-separated
	list of two or more alternative options. If only one alternative is set,
	this modification will be made to all models, which only makes sense if
	there are other sets of alternative modifications.
	The option names must be in upper case, unless ``none'' is specified, which
	is a marker for ``no modification of the record''.
	Example: -record_options=estimation:none, FAST means that each model should
	be run both with option FAST added to $ESTIMATION and no modification to
	$ESTIMATION.
	If more than one record-options combination is desired, the different
	combinations are separated with double comma (,,).
	Example: -record_options=est:none,FAST,,est:ATOL=10,ATOL=8,ATOL=12 which
	would result in six (2 times 3) variants of each model.
EOF

$help_text{-reference_lst} = <<'EOF';
    -reference_lst=list of lst files

	Add the results from one or more pre-existing .lst files to all raw_results.
	Saves time if reference results already are available, e.g. when comparing
	results from older NONMEM versions to a newly installed version.
EOF

$help_text{-replicates} = <<'EOF';
     -replicates=N

	Default 1. Can be set larger than 1 e.g. for run time comparisons.
	See note in user guide about user responsibility in ensuring run times are
	comparable.
EOF

$help_text{-theta_inits} = <<'EOF';
    -theta_inits=list

	Default not set.
	A structured list of the $THETA initial estimates to modify. If used, the
	$THETAs in question will be modified regardless of whether they are FIXED
	in the control stream. In the list, the $THETAs are identified by their
	order number, where numbering starts at 1, or by their PsN format label,
	as CL in this example:

	$THETA (0,1.005) ; CL

	In the list, after the theta label/number there must be a colon and then a
	comma-separated list of numbers to set as initial estimates. If 'none' is
	set it means do not change the input model.
	If an additional theta is to be modified, then a double comma separates the
	two sub-lists. If no $THETA pre-exists with the label given in the list, a
	$THETA will be added with that initial estimate and label.
	If $THETA number is used but no $THETA exists with that number then benchmark
	will halt with an error message. If the same theta is referred to with both
	label and theta number, this will not be detected by benchmark and will
	result in incorrect results.
	Example, using both label and theta number:

	-theta_inits=CL:none,1.5,1.0,,5:8.5,12
