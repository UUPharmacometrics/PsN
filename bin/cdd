    The Case Deletion Diagnostics tool is run using the command from the command line with a few mandatory arguments. 
	CDD is run as a diagnostic after a model is regarded finished or at least mature enough to run validation tool on. 
	The Case Deletions Diagnostics (CDD) algorithm is a tool primarily used to identify influential components of the dataset, 
	usually individuals. The CDD works by identifying groups in the data set and creating one new data set for each member 
	of the group, where that member has been removed. The model is run once with each new data set. The PsN implementation 
	of the CDD can take any column as base for the grouping and all rows with the same value in that column will be considered 
	a group as long as no individual contain multiple values in that column. One should take care that the grouping creates sensible 
	individual records. PsN will renumber the ID column so that two individuals with the same ID will not end up next to each other. 
EOF

	$help_text{Examples} = <<'EOF';
      cdd run89.mod -case_column=10
      
      This will perform a Case Deletion Diagnostic on the model specified in run89.mod based on the factors in column ten. If,
      for example, column ten holds the ids of the seven centers included in the study, this command will create seven copies of
      the dataset, each with individuals included in one specific center deleted. Say that the centers are numbered 1 to 7. Then
      dataset 1 will have individuals from center 1 excluded, dataset 2 individuals from center 2 and so on.
EOF

	$help_text{Options} = <<'EOF';  
A NONMEM model file with successful termination is required as argument.

      The following options are valid:
EOF
	$help_text{-case_column} = <<'EOF';
      -case_column=column_name|column_number

      Through this flag you set the column on which the case-deletion is done. You can either use the name of the column as specified
      in the $INPUT record in the model file or you can use the column number. Numbering starts with 1. Default is ID.
EOF
	$help_text{-h} = <<'EOF';
      -h | -?
      
      With -h or -? cdd will print a list of options and exit.
EOF
      
	$help_text{-help} = <<'EOF';      
      -help
      
      With -help cdd will print this, longer, help message.
EOF

	$help_text{-bins} = <<'EOF';
      -bins=number

      Sets the number of databins, or cdd datasets, to use. If the number of unique values, or factors, in the case column is
      higher than the number of bins then one or more factors will be deleted in each cdd dataset. Specifying $number as higher than
      the number of factors will have no effect. The bin number is then set to the number of factors. Default value = Number of unique values in the case column.
EOF

	$help_text{-etas} = <<'EOF';
      -etas

      Use the phi file of the original model as initial estimates for the etas.
EOF

	$help_text{-outside_n_sd_check} = <<'EOF';
      -outside_n_sd_check='number'

      Default 2. Mark the runs with Cook score - Covariance ratio outside X standard deviations of the principal component analysis (PCA).   
EOF

	$help_text{-selection_method} = <<'EOF';
      -selection_method='random' or 'consecutive'

      Default consecutive. Specifies whether the factors selected for exclusion should be drawn randomly or consecutively from the datafile. 
EOF

	$help_text{-update_inits} = <<'EOF';      
      -update_inits

      By default, the initial estimates of the cdd models will be set to the final estimates of the input model if final
	  estimates are available. If the user sets -no-update_inits, the initial estimates of the cdd models will be
	  the same as the initial estimates set in the input model, even if final estimates from the input model are available.
EOF
	$help_text{-xv} = <<'EOF';
      -xv|-no-xv

      Default false. Run the cross-validation step (-xv) or not (-no-xv).
EOF
