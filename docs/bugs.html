<h2 class="heading1">Known Bugs</h2>
<p>The most common source of errors is problems with psn.conf. Instructions about how to make correct settings can be found in 
<a href='https://github.com/UUPharmacometrics/PsN/releases/download/4.7.0/psn_configuration.pdf'>PsN Configuration.pdf</a>.</p>
<p> Like all software, PsN has bugs. Some unfixed bugs and known workarounds can be found in the document 
<a href='https://github.com/UUPharmacometrics/PsN/releases/download/4.7.0/known_bugs_and_workarounds.pdf'>Known Bugs and Workarounds.pdf</a>.

<h3>Known Bugs in PsN 4.7.0 </h3>

<ul>
	<li>sse will use the wrong simulated data for reestimation if the simulation model file has more than one $INPUT statement. The table file with 
	simulated data used for reestimation will only include the items from the last $INPUT. Note: It works fine to split $INPUT over several lines, 
	as long as the text $INPUT only appears once.</li><br>

	<li>Data values with more than five significant digits in sse. The simulated datasets used in sse are \$TABLE output from NONMEM, and NONMEM rounds 
	off values when printing tables. In NONMEM 6 1013201 is rounded to 1013200 (five significant digits), and if this makes a significant change to the 
	model estimation, for example if the value is a covariate, then the sse results will be wrong. In NONMEM 7 it is possible to set the FORMAT option 
	in $TABLE to make sure no important information is lost. With NONMEM 6 the user must make sure the rounding to five significant digits does not harm 
	the results.</li><br>

	<li>Lower case user defined and reserved words. Starting with NONMEM 7.2 lower case user defined and reserved words are supported. This is <b>not</b> 
	supported by PsN. For example in $INPUT all reserved words have to be upper case.</li><br>
    <li>proseval crashes if there is no IGNORE or ACCEPT statement in $DATA. Workaround is to add a dummy IGNORE or ACCEPT. proseval also crashes if an 
	IGNORE statement is written as IGN(VISI&gt;3) instead of IGNORE=(VISI&gt;3).
    </li><br>
