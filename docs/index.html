<h1>Perl-speaks-NONMEM</h1>
Perl-speaks-NONMEM (PsN) is a collection of Perl modules and programs aiding in the development of non-linear mixed 
effect models using NONMEM. The functionality ranges from solutions to simpler tasks such as parameter estimate 
extraction from output files, data file sub setting and resampling, to advanced computer-intensive statistical 
methods. PsN includes stand-alone tools for the end-user as well as development libraries for method developers. 
<p>Use the top menu for information on how to Download and Install PsN. You can read about the different parts of PsN 
under Documentation and also learn about Known Bugs, how to submit a new bug and how to become a part of the PsN mailing list.</p>
<br>
The latest release of PsN is version 5.6.0. Instructions on how to download it and a detailed list of changes can be found in the <a href="download.html">download section</a>. A brief list of what is new can be found below in the news section.

</ul>

<h3>Tags for PsNR releases (2019-09-20)</h3>
For rplots and qa to work properly each PsN version needs a specific version of PsNR. This will be handled by tagging PsNR versions with a PsN version tag. For PsN 4.9.0 this means
that it is not adviced to install PsNR from setup.pl. Please instead follow the <a href="https://uupharmacometrics.github.io/PsN/install.html">Psn installation instructions</a>

<h3>PsN 4.9.0 released (2019-06-05)</h3>

New features in this version include:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Many improvements to the quality assurance tool <strong>qa</strong></li>
    <li>New option parameters to <strong>sumo</strong> makes comparing model parameters and OFV easier</li>
    <li>R code for plotting has been moved to an R package <strong>PsNR</strong></li>
    <li>Stratification for <strong>crossval</strong></li>
    <li>New option <code>-debug_rmd</code> to keep the tex and md files when using <code>-rplots</code></li>
    <li>New clean level 5 to remove the entire run directory</li>
</ul>


<h3>PsN 4.8.1 released (2018-06-08)</h3>
This version is a very minor upgrade from 4.8.0. To simplify installation of all R packages needed for qa and rplots an R-script was added. It has an option to install the needed R packages into a separate library. Then a setting in psn.conf can set this library to be the default for PsN. When having problems with getting R plots out from PsN it is recommended to use this script to get the right versions of all R packages.

<br><br><code>Rscript PsN/R-scripts/install_R_packages.R myRlib</code>
<br><br>In psn-conf add:
<br><code>R_LIB_PATH=myRlib</code>

<h3>PsN 4.8.0 released (2018-05-25)</h3>

New features in this version include:<br>
<ul>
    <li>A new tool <strong>qa</strong> for fast and automatic assumption assessment and quality assurance of models</li>
    <li>A new tool <strong>transform</strong>, to manipulate model files. For example to automatically add IOV or Box-Cox transform ETAs</li>
    <li>A new optional directory structure using a subdirectory for each model via the option <tt>-model_subdir</tt></li>
    <li>The addition of support for vpc for mixture models</li>
    <li>Second order approximation added to the linearize tool</li>
    <li>The presentation of meta data in a new file, <strong>meta.yaml</strong>, which is in a both human and computer readable format</li>
</ul>
