# Individual objective function values can be a useful model
# selection diagnostic. Their use in the selection of covariates
# for inclusion in a non-linear mixed effects model is descibed
# in: Sadray, Jonsson and Karlsson, PharmRes, 16(8) 1999,
# pp. 1260-1265

# This script calculates the individual difference in objective
# function value between two models ("basic" and "full").  Optionally
# it also creates a file with the necessary fortran sub-routine.

# To use the script, you need perl installed on your system. Perl
# can be obtained free of charge from www.perl.com. Perl, and this
# script, can be used on both UNIX machines and PCs.

# Questions, comments and bug reports should be sent to

#              TO CREATE THE CONTR SUBROUTINE              #
################################################################

# To create the CONTR subroutine that is necessary to extract
# the individual objective function values, do the following:

#  1. On the command line, type:
#     perl ofv1 -p

#     This creates a file called iofvcont.f.

#  2. Open the iofvcont.f file for editing and change the
#     parameter statement on line two to reflect the number of
#     observations you have NONMEM compiled for. (The NONMEM
#     default is 50.)

#  3. Open the NM-TRAN model file for which you want to obtain
#     individual objective function values and add the following line
#     before the $SUBROUTINE line:
#     $CONTR DATA=(ID)

#  4. Change the $SUBROUTINE line to include the iofvcont.f file, e.g.:
#     $SUBROUTINE ADVAN4 TRANS2 CONTR=iofvcont.f

#  5. When the model is run, a file called fort80 (or something similar)
#     is created. It containes two columns. The first is the ID numbers
#     and the second the individual objectives.
#     There are (no of individuals)*(number of function evaluations) lines
#     the file. Only the last (no of individuals) lines are of interest.

# TO COMPUTE THE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION VALUE #
#                          BETWEEN TWO MODELS                           #
#########################################################################

# BACKGROUND

# The script assumes that the ID and associated individual objective
# function value are stored in two files.  These files will
# automatically be the output from the "iofvcont.f" file although
# the user has to rename the output file after each run.

# This is what you have to do in order to get a list of individual
# objective value differences between two models:

# 1. Create the iofvcont.f file (see above):

# 2. For each model you run, a file called "fort80" (or similar,
#    depending on your compiler) will be created.  It will usually be
#    very long and only the last number for each individual will be
#    used, but that is taken care of by the script.  What you need to
#    do is to rename this file after every run (to assure that it is
#    not written over).  If basic and final models are runs 5 and 6,
#    the following code can serve as example:

#    nmfe run5.mod run5.lst
#    mv ftn80 iotab5
#    nmfe run6.mod run6.lst
#    mv ftn80 iotab6

# 3. When you have run the basic and full model run the perl script by
#    typing:
#    perl ofv1

#    Thereafter follows instructions. Names of output files will be given.
