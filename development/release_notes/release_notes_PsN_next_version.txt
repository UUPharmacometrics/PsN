************************
Installation
************************

Follow the installation instructions on
https://uupharmacometrics.github.io/PsN/install.html

************************
Documentation
************************
All documentation is found in the doc subdirectory of the PsN 
installation directory. During installation it is also possible 
to have all documentation copied to a user-specified directory.

All documentation can also be downloaded from
the PsN website https://uupharmacometrics.github.io/PsN/docs.html

************************
Dependencies 
************************

- It is recommended to use Xpose version 4.5.3 or later for the -cwres functionality 
  and the default execute, vpc and bootstrap R plots.

- Each userguide lists the R packages required to obtain the diagnostic R plots.

************************
Known issues 
************************

- Windows users need to be careful to choose 
  a Perl version where the extra modules needed for PsN are available. 
  For new Perl installations the PsN team recommends Strawberry Perl
  See the instructions on https://uupharmacometrics.github.io/PsN/install.html

- Installation problem on some Windows systems where 
  perl 'system' command does not work. Make sure perl module File::Copy::Recursive
  is installed *before* (re)running the installation script setup.pl

*********************************************
Changes and bug fixes from PsN 4.7.0 to x.x.x
*********************************************




   ___General___

- New required perl module YAML::XS
- PsN will now give an error if an OMEGA or SIGMA BLOCK contains multiple FIX
  This would be inline with what NM-TRAN does.
- PsN runs now generate meta.yaml to systematically describe various metadata.
  See the psn.pdf for documentation.
- Fix bug causing datasets not to be filtered properly if ignore statement was written as IGN(VISI>3),
  i.e. with no equal sign.
- The psn_installation.pdf has been removed and all information it contained has been merged
  into the installation section of the webpage.
- The PsN_and_NONMEM7.pdf has been removed and all information it contained has been moved to PsN.pdf and
  other documentation.


   ___common_options___



   ___NONMEM output parsing___

  

   ___Cluster/Grid___



   ___Test scripts___



   ___execute___



   ___runrecord___

- No longer requires YAML::Tiny for csvy output. Will use the required YAML::XS


   ___sumo___



   ___bootstrap___



   ___vpc/npc___


   ___frem___
   
   ___proseval___

- Bugfix: proseval would crash if no filtering was needed due to no accept or ignore in $DATA


   ___scm___

- Bugfix: Remove IGNORE or ACCEPT statements for linearized models that would else crash.
- Linearized scm will always evaluate the derivatives model and not estimate it.
- New option nointer to not use interaction for linearized scm
- Linearized scm supports finding parameter-eta relation in two steps i.e.:
    ETA_CL = ETA(1), TVCL = THETA(1), CL = TVCL * EXP(ETA_CL)
    will properly be detected. Search is also done in $ERROR
- Bugfix: Models with IGNORE=() and IGNORE=C where C is not @ caused scm to crash
- Changed boundaries for covariate effect theta on exponential effect to be adaptive given an effect size within 0.01 and 100
  This to reduce the risk of overflow.
- Fix formatting of OFV values in scm log to avoid two numbers be put directly next to each other

   ___linearize___

- Ignore all MDV!=0 in linear model if MDV obtainable
- Support models with extension .ctl
- Do not propagate name of -dir to subtools (i.e. underlying scm directory will always be called scm_dir1)
- Only evaluate (MAXEVALS=0) the derivatives model. If lst file is available update initial values first.
- New option nointer to not use interaction
- Do not use COM in derivatives.mod to avoid name clash
- Avoid NONMEM crash by adding dummy thetas for omegas that have not ETA(X) in code.

   ___nca___

- Set number of samples to default 300.



   ___xv_scm___



   ___sse___ 


   ___simeval___
   

   ___runrecord___


- Fix bug causing est_time and cov_time to not be added to table for NONMEM 7.4

   ___update_inits___


   ___parallel_retries___


   ___sir___
	

   ___precond___

- Give error if model does not have any THETAS (i.e. linearized model)


   ___cdd___

- Fix critical bug (#50) casusing dofv to be calculated in a wrong way if any individual was ignored.
- Do not propagate -dir to subtools (i.e. subdir of modelfit of cdd runs will always be 'modelfit_dir1') 


   ___rplots___

   ___nmoutput2so___

- Bugfixes for simulation results that caused nmoutput2so to crash
- Change columnType for TIME in SimulatedProfiles from time to idv


   ___transform___

- Added remove_0fix_omegas, tdist, full_block, add_tv, add_iov, iiv_on_ruv, power_on_ruv and omit_ids transformations

   ___resmod___ 

- Don't run dtbs and power for models giving negative IPRED
